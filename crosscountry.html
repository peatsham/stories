  <h1>CROSS COUNTRY</h1>
  
  <p>Small towns are beautiful. Just a hop skip and a jump to the countryside. From St James Terrace to the Dukes Meadow was a short walk. Here the dog walkers enjoyed the heavenly Wye. A powerful vein of clear water through the green pastures. Each morning I made my devotion. Now it was time to head west.</p> 
          <p>In the small front yard I prepared ye old mountain bike. Two bright blue square vinyl water butts with a piece of dowling jammed through the handles slotted over the back rack to form panniers. With a Stanley knife I sliced openings in their sides. I was pleased with my neo-ethnic styling. I squeezed through the garden gate and pedaled down the road.</p>
         <p>Imbolc was a good time to set forth. The days were a cock stride longer and hope was on the horizon. I moved down the A465. A restless soul in search of adventure. Through the rolling countryside I reached a high hillside with a view over the beckoning Welsh landscape. I pulled into a gateway, perched my bicycle and clambered into a field where a grand old oak awaited my arrival. I sat beneath his stately bows and leaned upon his handsome trunk. A last blim filled my pipe and I smoked it up and gazed across the border. All this could be mine!</p>
           <p>I zoomed on down the hill. Snowdrops flowered on the verge. Freedom is a beautiful illusion. My bicycle whistled a soulful tune and time made distance. The landscape embraced me. As evening approached I steered into a picturesque churchyard. I perched my bicycle by the porch and took a stroll up to a local shop. A pleasantly higgledy-piggledy rural business. The strange old proprietress eyed me with suspicion as I perused the goods. Circling through the narrow passages between the shelves I at last gathered together cheese, a round lettuce, tomatoes and a small loaf. I payed up and departed, followed by her scrutinous gaze.</p>
           <p>Back to my lonesome spot. The last rays of sun warmed me as I lent against the church wall. The place of worship was closed but the ample porch had no door. I slowly layed out my sleeping bag on my carry mat and sat down. Here in my shady spot it was already dark. I took two slices of bread and broke off a piece of cheese and a hunk of lettuce and fashioned a primitive sandwich. I bit into the bundle and enjoyed the chunky snack. After a slow mastication and an eventual swallow I took another mouthful and began to chew. Hoping for a similarly nutritious morsel I was unpleasantly surprised. This time the succulent texture was interrupted by a cloyingly sticky substance. I at once began to expunge the offensive mouthful but the slug was now smeared on my palette and refused to leave. By rubbing my fingers around my mouth I managed to extract the thick of it but residue remained. I repeatedly rinsed my mouth with water but my eating for the night was over and I lay down to compose myself and eventually drifted off to sleep.</p>
           <p>By the morning my mouth felt human again. The memory of the night before encouraged me to rinse it. I loaded up my butts and eased into action. The thorny hedges whispered their story and the passerines darted in and out of their twisted branches. Soon I arrived at the famous church of Kilpeck. A well preserved 12th century classic that has escaped the ravages of modern religion. Medieval carvings abound. Strange charicatures of all manner of animals and the famous Sheela na Gig. A small crouched figure with a comical face pulls open her ample vagina. I marveled at the pagan pageant that had escaped the 17th century purge of the puritans. Here would have been a fine place to make my camp but it was early in the day. Elated, I traveled on. Past the large sawmill at Pontrilas my wheels kept on turning. By early afternoon I arrived at Abergavenny.</p>
             <p>Time for a busk in this pleasant town with hilly roads. Reluctantly I pitched on a slope and hoped my money would not roll away. The public approved and coins were carefully placed in my case. Some Canadians invited me to come and play in their bar in Vancouver. It was a nice idea. Takings were good. I shopped for food supplies and carried on down the road. Where would I make my home tonight? I eyed the waysides for refuge.</p>
          <p>After a gentle decline the road leveled by a tranquil woodland. Young evenly spaced sweet chestnuts coloured a welcoming scene. In I went. The calm evening air held no portent of rain and the gentle boughs separated the sky. Here I felt a sublime calm of contemplation. My thoughts moved from human banality to natural equanimity. Timeless time layed out my comforts. I ate and relaxed. People were far away.</p> 
          <p>Slowly the long night descended. I awoke to the scuffling of wildlife. Who was this interloper in their woods? A strange smelling bi-ped and his collection of clutter. Hopefully he would be gone in the morning. A one night stand with eternity. To sleep perchance to dream. Away from the oppressor's wrong. With a bare bodkin, who would fardels bear?</p>
        <p>I awoke to grunt and sweat once more, packed up and wound my way. I was on the road to Brecon. It would be a picturesque climb. A slow rise gradually increased into a steep ascent into the beacons. Up hill and down dale I laboured. At last I stepped off and pushed my steed. The heavy load swung from side to side as I went. The rickety rack creaked and broke away from its central attachment. The load took a ninety degrees plunge to the ground behind the wheel. Still intact and attached to the supports from the axel it dragged along. The rusty bolt had sheared. I contemplated my crisis. I had no spare bolt. I knitted my brow and searched my grey matter for a solution.</p>
          <p>Two old innertubes secured my pack above the water-butt panniers on the rack. I released one and adjusted the other to keep the bag secure. I cut a section and bound the bracket back into place. I pushed on with a wobble. Another slope up and another slope down.The day warmed and I shed a layer. Through the majestic landscape and the final ascent to Brecon. I found the precinct and perched my velocipede. Between the optician and the stationers I made my pitch. The acoustics were good and the melody resounded. A coin was thrown into my case. From the shiny opticians shop appeared a well dressed lady. She stood close and gave me the evil eye. I paused for her address. She struggled to articulate her distaste.</p>
        <p>-You cannot … do this here!- She blurted out. I stood in silence and considered how to escape her hysteria. My presence provoked her perturbation. How could I disentangle now? As I pondered her anger increased.<br>
       -Right, I'm calling the police!- she insisted. She turned and departed. I let her hot heel away and believed she was quite serious in her resolve. I decided it would be wise to leave. Slowly I packed up and wheeled my bicycle out of the precinct. As I looked back I saw the enthusiastic keystone cop arriving on the scene. He looked around at the lack of evidence as I began to cycle away. Quite a storm in a teacup.</p>
         <p>I returned to the A40 and steered West. Along the head of the valleys towards Llandovery was a slow but steady ten mile climb to Trecastle and slowly down again to the quiet town. I played my inconsequential music to the inconsequential audience. The few pounds added up to a respectable amount. Twenty pounds would keep the wolf from the door. I bought my supplies and turned to the narrow road over the mountain to Tipi Valley. Here I had to push with my arms outstretched, leaning into the hill. Down the other side I dared not take my hands off the brakes. Then at last up the dirt track through the pines. I stopped by the babbling brook. A conversation seemed to flow through the ripples. The spirits guided me in. This was not the main gate but a small path into the back garden. A tipi was pitched either side of the path. A lady gathered kindling by her lodge.<br>
-Just arrived?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Heading for the big lodge?<br>
-Yeah.<br>
-Or you could ask the guy in that tipi if you can share with him.<br>
-Ok<br>
     <p>I knocked on a pole and the dweller popped his head out. I explained the neighbour's suggestion and he agreed. He was a genuine searcher and embraced the spiritual path. Simon had worked on cruise ships and now left the mainstream to lead a simple life. My subtle entrance had furbished me with an equitable companion. Generally newcomers or occasional visitors stayed in the big lodge where all sorts of characters would appear. We shared stories and cooked on the open fire. The 11 foot tipi made a comfortable abode for two. He had already been there for three months and was ingraciated into the scene. The next morning brought other youngsters to visit. He introduced me as an old friend and I was cordially accepted into the crowd. Such fortunes can shine upon the lonesome traveller.</p>
       <p>Burnable wood was scarce in the locality as the area had been well foraged. In the afternoon we made a long trek over the hill to find a fallen beech. We sawed some tidy limbs and hauled them home. A sedate evening ensued. On the morrow we headed to a meeting at the big lodge. Simon and I sat quietly as young idealists quibbled for supremacy. The egomaniacal power wielders of the festival scene were in the making. Content with our silence we retreated for a composed lunch. Once again we went in search of wood to a steep hillside where ragged overgrown larch trees toppled over. This inferior fire wood supplemented our choice gains from yesterday. We cooked our simple fare and told our humble tales.</p>
      <p>The sprawling habitation of the South side of the valley encompassed various zones. Here at the bottom meadow were Tipis, yurts and domes. Higher up where a road was accessible Trucks, Caravans and shacks lined the way. Some houses at the edges were now owned by members of the community. We were invited to a book reading group. Mao Zedong’s little red book seemed like an odd choice but it was pleasant to be in a comfortable living room and the more poetic of Mao’s musings seemed to be the focus. From civilization we returned to our humble tipi. Our frugal rhythm continued.</p> 
        <p>Friday was full moon and a sweat lodge would take place amongst the tipis. We contributed to the wood pile. As evening descended Luna rose to whoops of enthusiasm. A large roaring fire was ablaze. Out of the twilight the crowd gathered. Stones were placed in the flames to heat. A large pipe of cannabis was passed around. I imagined such a capacious bowl would contain only a mild strength of weed like a pint pot containing beer. I took a big toke. I was mistaken. Having stayed with my abstemious companion for a week I had forgotten that many of the tipi dwellers were regularly smoking the sinsemilla.</p> 
         <p>The personnel disrobed and held hands around the fire and began to circle the flames. We joined the group. The hot rocks were carried on pitch forks into the lodge. A small structure of thin bent hazel poles covered in tarpaulins. The circle broke and a long haired lady led us under the dark canvas cover. When about twenty people were huddled inside the warm space water was ladled onto the rocks and a shocking wave of steam enveloped us. Hypnotic songs were sung and another bout of intense steam rolled. It was a great feeling. As the heat intensified it became overwhelming. Someone called to be let out and the door was opened. Cool air rushed in but as it closed the heat rose again. The chants continued. Thoughts dissolved in the ether. I was stoned out of my mind and began to feel paranoid. I made my way out into the fresh air. My fellow tipi dweller asked if I was ok. I retreated to our tipi to space out.</p>
          <p>My spiritual bubble had popped and the weight of intoxication was upon me. I lay down confused. Tomorrow I would travel on. Away from the congregation.</p>
         <p>I loaded up my panniers and bid farewell to my comrade. Down the road and a turn left took me up a steep hill. Onward and upward (ymladd ymlaen) I advanced. Northwards to Llanidloes kept me walking my bicycle for miles. I retreated into the pine forest for a break. Human interaction was such a difficult business. The gentle sway of the trees was easy on my mind. Why not stay here? Had I nothing better to do? Time disintegrated into space and mere perceptions filled me. I was intentionally homeless. I would stay the night in this delightful spot! The day began to grey. I decided to craft a shelter. I wedged fronds of pine between the narrow trees. My primitive soul found solace in creation. Like a bird building a nest I followed my instincts. At last I had a home. A wondrous home. A delight to behold! I glugged down some water as the day sailed away. Before the night fell I climbed into my bag. A heavy mist hung in the air. As the dark curled through the trees the moisture began to descend. Slowly seeping through the leaves the drops tip tapped on my bag. I hoped it would stop but the rain began to fall. In the deep darkness of the night I felt the damp soak through. I slept on into wetness.  At daybreak I roused my cool countenance to the world. With a feeble shiver I packed up and travelled on. I warmed as I cycled.</p> 
                <p>I reached the small town of Rhayader and found the launderette. At this early opening hour I loaded my sleeping bag into the dryer. I still had change to spare. I watched the tumbling bag with satisfaction. I would find more substantial cover tonight. My clothes were drying with my body warmth and the comfortably ambient temperature of the quiet establishment. Forever I swung from one tenuous limb to another. Like a monkey I was dancing my whole life. My coins ran out and the bag was dry. I packed it up and went for breakfast. A pot of yogurt and fruit was delicious. The rain had stopped and the sun broke through the clouds. I relaxed on a bench and listened to an unknown bird. A gentle breeze urged me on my way in the morning sunshine. Up and down hill I trapsed. The sun dryed me out and I paused to admire the landscape. I moved slowly, considering carefully my options for the evening. I did not want a repeat of last night's unfortunate outcome.The afternoon clouded over. Down a small side road I could see a group of large farm buildings. I motivated towards them and parked my bicycle down a discreet bridleway into the woods. Daintily I traversed the edge of the concrete yard and eased open a large sliding door. Counterweights rolled it along and I caught hold of it and pulled it closed. Now inside the cavernous prefabricated building my eyes adjusted to the darkness and among varied farm machinery was parked an old double decker bus. I peeked out into the yard to check no-one was around and made my way to the bus.The doors folded open and under a layer of dust everything was as if it was still in service. I climbed the stairs and found myself a seat. What an ideal shelter. I imagined the miles travelled and the passengers in and out before its rural retirement. After my initial excitement I considered the possibility of being observed. I contemplated in silence and heard nothing. Slowly and carefully I made my way out once again. I would return at dusk to make my bed. I chilled in the woodland for the afternoon before making my way back to the bus as the darkness descended. After last night's escapade I was blessed in my comfort. I rolled out my mat before the upstairs back seat and lay down to extenuate my meandering mind. I dreamed of distant deserts travelled by foot in a bedouin shroud. I awoke and savoured the musty atmosphere. After rolling up my bed I secreted it below the seat and tiptoed out of the autobus. Quietly I nipped across the yard and over the lane into the trees. My bicycled lazed by the path, waiting for a return to action. I fought the furrows up to the tarmac and with a little less weight than usual turned my wheels towards Llanidloes. A slightly longer few miles than I had anticipated brought me close to the equanimous town. A small Co-op indicated the beginning of the settlement. I continued into the pleasantly kept old fashioned town. I wandered up and down the high street and perused the butchers, bakers and candlestick makers. Even a book shop found a spot. I entered and was surprised to find a section of sheet music. A collection of O'Malley's traditional Irish tunes was a classic. Priced at £5.95 it had to be purchased. I counted up my shrapnel and payed the elegant shop keeper. The purple cover had a simple white sketch of a couple of old men playing a fiddle and the uilleann pipes. That was the life!</p>
                     <p>I figured the Co-op would be a good spot to busk. I edged out of town, parked my bicycle out of the way and perched under the canopy by the entrance. Old ladies smiled their approval and youngsters nodded. Here in the small rural towns folk were always courteous. As they entered the shrine they made their offerings to my humble sideshow. When I had enough coins I too entered. Ham, cheese, bread and tomato and a can of bitter would make a fine lunch!</p>
         <p>I pedaled back towards my refuge and stopped in a sunny field to aliment. I opened my can and took a swig. I placed it by me in the grass and prepared an appetising sandwich. I munched my way through it with gusto. I looked to my can of beer but it had tumbled over on the soft ground. The beer was all drained away. For a moment I fumed at my foolishness but soon reconciled myself to fate. With no liquid to swill down my food I decided to content myself with the single sandwich. The sunshine made me sleepy and I dozed off. I awoke to the heavy breathing of cows as they edged their way towards me. As I sat up they jumped back away from me. I feared for my bicycle as they clumsily plodded around. I stood up and they scattered. I edged out of the field and continued to my wood. The rays of sun patterned the trees as they swayed in the gentle breeze. I rooted out a book from my baggage. “ On The Road” was not what I expected. Hoping for a story like my own I was disillusioned by the privileged protagonist receiving handouts from his aunty. His hedonistic journey was far removed from my solitary cycling. Though I shared his love of music my voyage led me a lonely road. Like jazz improvisations the empty space cleared the air for close harmony to come.</p>
         <p>In the late afternoon I made my way back to the bus. Another early night and an early awakening. As I lay in my morning slumber contemplating Life, the Universe and everything I heard the large barn door roll back along its rails. I pinned up my ears and kept as still as a mouse. Heavy boots paced the concrete floor. After a general ramble around the shed they neared the bus. A moment of pause and the doors were slowly opened. My heart began to pace. The boots stepped inside. What grizzly creature could be approaching?I threw my metaphorical monkey's paw into the fire. The monster retreated and closed the door. The footsteps left the shed and the door was rolled back to a close.</p>
          <p>I waited a good while and then slowly tidied up my kit. I made my way out with all my belongings and returned to my bicycle. I was ready to continue my voyage. At Llangurig I took the A44 to Aberystwyth. A few miles up and a few miles down. A last little climb before the great descent to the sea. A joyous tune whistled through my handlebars as I coasted the distance. I stopped only for water and reached the former capital of Wales by mid-afternoon. The sun blessed my arrival and I found a spot on the beach. With crackers and cheese I lazed away the day.
