  <h1>THE MAN</h1>
<p>I stepped onto the tube train. He sat in the 
centre of the 
empty carriage 
spreading himself out lethargically. Was this a normal posture I wondered. 
He was not dirty or untidily dressed but I sensed a discrepancy. His face 
was a little red and his smile a little self centred. He sat up straight 
and I believed he was in fact a respectable citizen who had now composed 
himself after a moment of relapse. He leaned over to his backpack between 
his legs and retrieved a tin of strong lager. I realised he was not the 
conformist I had believed. He cracked the can and brought it slowly to his 
pouting lips. He sucked in his first draft and lowered the drink. He 
breathed a deep sigh of relief. He was comfortable and warm in company 
with a drink. Now I remembered him. I had seen him walking along the 
towpath carrying two large plastic bags. I had given a nod of greeting but 
he had turned away with a desperately tortured expression. His homeless 
plight rang out. Now on the underground he dissimulated as a member of 
society. Maybe an alcoholic breaking regulations but not apparently 
homeless. The tell-tale bags were now secreted in the undergrowth. He 
drank again and breathed deeply. He was content.</p>
