<h1>THE WALK</h1>
I lace up my sturdy hiking boots and climb the stairs to the front door . Out onto the high street a fresh wind chills my face . I tighten my scarf and cross over . I pass the local pub and ascend the steep staircase between the stone houses . I turn along the next well kept street and pass the shiny new cars . Few rooves still have chimneys and only a few smoke . I turn up a steep road past a modern house across from the old school . Up the gravel track taking me onto the mountainside . The overgrown pine forests are edged with deciduous trees and a variety of plants . Grassy banks with rocky outcrops . Across the valley the green mountains have no trees but are dotted with sheep . I look back at the already small town and beyond see the larger steeper mountains at the head of the valley . I continue slowly up . High in the sky a large bird of prey glides on the wind . A gushing stream splashes through the grass and disappears beneath the track . I pass the forest and reach open fields divided by carefully constructed dry stone walls . The cows turn and stare . As I pass they lurch away and jog down the hillside . The track levels off and turns towards another pine forest . I turn down a little muddy footpath between the side of a hill and a hedgerow . A green woodpecker darts out of the hedge and with a flap and glide advances onto the next bush . A dense growth of ferns is turning a beautiful shade of autumnal yellow . The path takes me round to the open side of the hill . From here I view the vast panorama . A cluster of windmills are turning . The modern buildings of an expanding farm . The ruins of an old house . Further away another group of windmills are too small to see their movement . The tiny silhouette of a barge can be seen on the misty expanse of the Bristol channel . Beyond are the dark hills of Dorset . I savour the space and continue around the curve of the hill taking me back into the valley . Below is another small settlement . Ribbons of terraced houses pattern away from the main road . I pass over a concrete drainage channel , follow a wall , pass through a gateway and return to the gravel road . At my side a sharp incline holds large pines creating a dark and ominous space . As I descend another track from behind the gardens of the outlying houses joins the way . A steep verge at the intersection has been lovingly turned into a rockery garden . I continue down and as I pass the vehicle barrier an old sign still advises the forestry wagons to slow down and sound their horns as they go by the now disused school . I follow the road straight back down to the high street and turn up the slight incline towards my house . I pass the tattoo studio , the beauty parlour , the value shop and the barberâ€™s and arrive at my front door opposite the old photographic studio . I enter and sit on the armchair in the front room and relax .
