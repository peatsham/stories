  <h1>THE ESCAPE</h1>
                       <p>I continued to creep around the wall and once again came to the bed. The infernal bed, bolted down and forever blocking my path. This time I would creep underneath the blasted thing. I squeezed down. My hair caught on the bedstead and was torn away. I winced in pain and pushed on. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness I saw it. A large hole. The entrance to a tunnel! Now it all made sense. This is how the women escaped. No need to jump out of the window or brave the pathways. Straight out to the forest. I released myself from my rope and scrambled into the wet dark opening and tumbled down the steep gravelly slope. I landed in the dark. I felt my way deeper into the narrow passageway. Like a worm I slithered into the gap. Pulling myself forward with my hands the sharp stones ripped away my clothes and tore my skin. I pushed with my knees and feet as the rock sliced into me. The damp seeped down onto me and blended with my sweat. My mind blank with  struggle I clawed on. Gasping through the dirt I persevered. The passage broadened and a dim light gave relief. I rose onto my hands and knees. As the tunnel curved a bright spec of daylight appeared. Thank God! My simmering hysteria gave way to elation. Out of the mouth of the cave the forest welcomed me. I lay in the damp ivy and gazed through the trees at the cloudy sky. Such a thirst came upon me. I found a puddle and sucked up the water.</p> 
                            <p>After a rest I felt well and began to explore the woods. Such large and beautiful trees. I felt I saw the women in my peripheral vision but each time I looked  they disappeared behind the ample trunks. Now far away from the house the forest sloped away into a valley. The indigenous oak, elm and ash gave way to a plantation of tall pines. Uniform lines of straight poles shed their needles covering the ground and allowing nothing to grow . The lush woodland became sterile and dry. Their linear pattern defied perspective, producing a blank array. Though I gazed into monotony a square shape appeared. I moved towards it and realised there was a structure. High among the conifers, between four well placed stems, a perfectly square log cabin constructed of the same pine that supported it. As I approached I saw the ladder leading up to the plane front face with a single door. Each perpendicular side had a central window. I climbed up but found the blank wooden entrance padlocked. Unencumbered by my heavy dress I clambered around the corner grabbing onto the rough edges. I stretched forth and took hold of the bars that defended the window. With both arms I pulled myself up to the glass and gazed in. Smooth white walls revealed beneath the torn away yellow wallpaper now lying in crumpled piles on the floor. Opposite the door the immovable bed and there in the centre am I. Still in my beautiful white dress. My gentle chestnut curls hanging down as I weep over my poor dear John.</p>
