  <h1>CARDIFF</h1>
  <p>I found my stop at the station. Twenty minutes to wait until my bus arrived. Roaches littered the floor. I decided to pick a few up. I had time to visit the toilet and check out if any had a bit of weed in them. I tore them apart and found only one had very fine crumbs of green leaves amongst the tobacco. I carefully picked them out and discarded the nicotine. I took my pipe from my pocket and loaded it up. I sparked it up and with one large inhalation smoked the herbage. I kept the smoke in until there was none left to exhale. I wondered whether such a smattering of grass would have any effect. I exited the toilet to return to my stop. I hoped a mild cannabinoid intoxication would mellow out my journey. What happened next was not what I expected. Not a mild light headed cerebral elevation but something very different. My legs began to bend and sink into the ground. I felt pulled from either side by a strange force. Soon I could not remember where I was or where I was going. Carrying my ukulele felt like an immense burden. I struggled to keep moving for fear of collapsing into the ground. If I could escape this urban maze and find a field I could fall into the grass and let this madness pass. I was walking in front of the train station and lurched towards a bench. I put down my ukulele but was too restless to sit. I began to sway like a flower in the wind. My feet were nailed to the ground but the lightness of my body allowed me to lean over to an incredible degree. It was a wonderous experience. I made sweeping curves as I gyrated in circles. People watched my wonderous display in awe. I marveled at my magical movement. Two policemen approached slowly.
        -Good Afternoon sir-
I continued to sway. 
        -Are you alright?-
I looked at the policeman.               
        -I don't know-
  My mind had become quite clear, yet my body swayed to a rhythm of its own. I managed to look towards the policeman as I continued my miraculous balance.
       -Do you know what I've taken?- was my serious question. Now he entered into the parley with more humour.
      -I'd have thought you might have known that!-.On this quizzical point we seemed to be at a deadlock. I wobbled on. The law watched. Eventually my swinging around slowed. I managed to stand straight. More policemen gathered. I was a source of amusement. At last I tired and sat down on the bench with my ukulele. The officers approached. I gave them my name and address and explained I had smoked an unknown substance I had retrieved from a discarded joint.
        -Well, you won't be doing that again!- they quipped. I remembered I was in Cardiff on my way to my house in Ogmore Vale. They suggested I continue. I was relieved they took no further action. Who knows what shit I smoked. After hearing stories and observing the street life in Cardiff I concluded it was probably a small dose of  "Spice". Plant matter is saturated with these artificially created legal highs imported from distant countries. My first and only dose probably gave me a exciting trip but regular users could be seen comatose in unfeasible positions. I caught the fast train to Bridgend and the slow bus up to Ogmore Vale. I was happy to get home.
