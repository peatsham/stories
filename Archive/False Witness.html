<h1>FALSE WITNESS</h1>
                    I had recently arrived in London and decided to go for a
cycle ride and explore . Unfortunately my bicycle had a puncture . My
girlfriend had bought her son a shiny new  BMX and as he was at school for the
day I asked her if I could take it out for a spin . On the condition that I
was not gone too long and was very careful she agreed . As I was only going to
take in some sights I took nothing but my phone . An old brick my father had
found discarded in the launderette . Nobody had called to claim it so I had
topped up the pay as you go credit and joined the modern world .
                    I zoomed down the road feeling the exhilaration of the
agile little bicycle . Winding through the residential roads I ended up at a
large roundabout and turned down the Hammersmith road towards Kensington . As
I entered this unknown territory I spotted an attractive park across the road
on the right . I slowed my speed , dismounted and crossed the zebra crossing .
Before entering the park I took a look around to remember my whereabouts . A
police van was passing by and the driver gave me an angry scowl . Unwisely I
scowled back . I  passed through the gates located a bench and sat down to
relax and admire the greenery .  Finding my composure I looked around to see
the hostile policeman running toward me with intent . An athletic figure with
a steely grey crew cut followed by two shorter more corpulent officers . I
stood up to address him . He approached very close and immediately began to
infer that I had stolen what he considered to be a child’s bicycle and it
would be better for me if I came clean . I immediately explained that I had
borrowed it from my girlfriend’s son . With a swift and well practiced move he
took my arm and placed me in handcuffs with my wrists back to back . Surprised
by the uncompromising position in which I had been placed I twisted and turned
to find a comfortable posture . Having snared his prey P C Williamson looked
on with an air of satisfaction . He explained that if I sat back down on the
bench with my hands between my legs I would be more at ease . His quarry now
securely placed in the position of an offender he felt sure the confession
would be forthcoming . He was implacable when his astute intuition was proven
wrong .                                          We went through the story
again . He required me to stand and be searched . He took my phone and
examined it . Beneath his grey hair his grey matter began to tick . He
enquired whether the girlfriend’s name and number were on the phone . I
replied in the affirmative . He wisely postulated if he were to phone her she
would bare witness to my story . He phoned her and she corroborated explaining
she had recently purchased the bicycle from Acton cycles and retained the
receipt . He passed my phone to his assistant and it was taken to the van . He
went through the story again . An older officer observed and occasionally
interjected a carefully placed question . The PCSO returned with information .
Williamson stated that he knew the name I had given was false . The PCSO
searched around in the grass for evidence . Williamson appealed to my better
nature to do the right thing and tell them my real name . Once again I
appealed that I had given my real name . Repeatedly he hammered the nail into
my forehead . He knew it was not my real name . If I would be smart and tell
them my real name they would let me go . Five , ten , twenty times they
persisted until my sanity became frail  .
After conferring with the older officer he asked whether I had any
identification anywhere . I had a passport at the address I had given them .
He proposed we go there directly and get the id . I readily agreed . He spoke
to the older officer and returning with  an exasperated look supposed he would
have to let me go . Still not believing that this strange fish he had hooked
was not of the poisonous variety he rooted beneath his bullet proof layers for
the small key to the handcuffs . Released from my shackles I slowly wheeled my
bicycle away . Undoubtedly they would be watching my next move . I decided to
get myself a mobile phone registered to my own name.
