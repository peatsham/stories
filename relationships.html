  <h1>RELATIONSHIPS</h1>
                       <p>STEVE</p>
<p>I laugh and joke with Mary and John as we leave the bar and head to the party. Flashing lights guide us into the living room disco. The host welcomes me into the crowd. Out of the kitchen struts a striking dark haired lady. Oh my god it's Elizabeth. My relaxed and happy state is shattered. My balance falters and I feel awkward and cold. I try to speak but merely move my head and let my mouth drop open. The host motions an introduction as Elizabeth stands tall and proud. “Hello Steven”. I recoil into an introverted silence and bring my hand to my face in consternation. “How have you been ?”  I feebly attempt a reply as her slender figure breezes past me towards more competent company. I escape into the kitchen. I need a drink.</p> 

<p>ELIZABETH</p>
<p>I hear him enter. He is jovial with friends. He is not expecting to see me. I knew he was coming. I am prepared and strong. I am beautiful. He chats to the host with his usual good humour and nonchalant charm. I leave the kitchen and confidently approach. Shocked out of his comfort zone his bubble is broken. No longer the social butterfly flitting from flower to flower he struggles to deal with the situation. I reject him and move on. It had to be done. I could not let him get away,  leaving me with only the threads of a rumour. It was not merely a casual affair that dispersed into the stream of circumstance. I will not sympathise. He crawls away to find his solace.  Mary and John greet me with a hug.</p>

<p>ALEX</p>
<p>At last the people begin to arrive. My preparations have not been in vain. The usual crowd is ready to party. Tim and Sally come with a new friend. Tall and elegant, she is a little reserved. After a long visit to the bathroom she steers herself into the kitchen away from the casual dance of the living room. I am tempted to follow and break the ice but feel I need to stay and greet my guests. Fashionably late the real partygoers begin to arrive. Sophy and Dan bring a bottle of Dom Perignon 96. Mary, John and Steve are bubbling with good vibes. I am beginning to relax as the laughter and joking begins. Steve tells me a tale of a trip abroad and I remember what good company he is. Lovely Elizabeth emerges from the kitchen with a newly found confidence. I motion for her to come and join my intimate chat with Steve but all is not well as I turn to Steve and see his cool has crumbled. Elizabeth sternly greets him and marches on with disdain. She crosses the room and cozies up with Mary and John. This is not good. I find Steve slumped by the kitchen table with a large glass of whisky. If Steve gets on a downer it could ruin the whole party. My only option is to stay and console him. I pour myself a scotch and sit down at his side.</p>
