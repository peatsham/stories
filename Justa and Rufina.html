  <h1>JUSTA AND RUFINA</h1>
  <p>From an early age their father had taught them the skills of pottery. Justa could throw a perfect vase, delicately molding the form on the potterâ€™s wheel. Rufina painted the sacred images of the life of Christ. The feeding of the five thousand, the sermon on the mount and the stations of the cross wrapped the earthenware in beautiful colours and images. Their disciplined work was molded in the Christian religion. The lessons of Jesus guided them through their struggles . With humility they overcame their poverty. Resisting the temptations of the pagan city around they dedicated themselves to their vocation. They provided well for their father and helped the needy. Their pots became sought after and the news of their good deeds spread, but with their fame came controversy. The status quo was threatened. A local dignitary approached them and requested some of their fine work emblazoned with the image of Venus. They could not and would not produce it. Their refusal was confirmation of subversion. The indignant rabble was roused. With little opposition they gathered at the door of Justa and Rufina. The anonymous crowd slandered their names. The doors broken down, the sisters were pushed aside and their neatly gathered months of work righteously smashed to smithereens. The sisters slumped to the ground in tears as the destroyers left. Distraught, they embraced one another as they surveyed the wreckage. Exhausted they sat until Justa pulled herself to her feet. Wiping away her tears revealed a look with a vengeance. Rufina tried to hold her back. She implored her not to go, to remember the teachings of their Lord Jesus Christ. Justa cast her aside and marched directly to the central square. People were gathering for the festival of Veneralia. She pushed through the crowd, kicked her way through the offerings and pulled at the garlands festooning the naked Venus. The twine would not break and the statue tumbled from its pedestal. Its face hit the ground and the head broke away. Justa and the crowd stared at the decapitated goddess. Seized by the Roman guard, Justa relapsed into her tearful state. Rufina came running to embrace her sister. Together they were marched to prison with the shouts of the rabble close behind. The learned prefect Diogenianus was informed of the disruption to the veneration of Venus Verticordia. He descended from his stately offices to mediate. The terrorists were brought to kneel before him. Did they have anything to say in their defence? Gentle Rufina explained that it had not been their intention to desecrate the sacred shrine of Venus. Diogenianus looked at the stubbornly silent Justa. Did she concur with her sister? She would not speak. The prefect believed their heretical religion had left them socially isolated, causing their antagonism which resulted in their explosive behaviour. He explained that if they were willing to show their appreciation of the benevolent society that sustained them they would be released. He wished them to produce a large vase with a colourful image of the garlanded Venus. He suggested they take their time and think carefully about his offer. They were left in a dark dungeon with meagre rations. Their father implored the prefect to release them as they had committed no serious crime. His terms had been stated and after one month the sisters were consulted. Their resolve was immovable. With iron hooks through their hands and feet they were stretched on the rack. Still they would not yield. Diogenianus felt the present method of rehabilitation seemed ineffective and decided on a new course of action. A hundred mile pilgrimage to the majestic mountains of the Sierra Morena may help them understand the munificence of the gods. In shackles with wounded feet they were marched through the blistering sunshine. By the grace of God they survived their journey but still they would not repent. Returning to their dismal dungeon, Justa became feeble and perished but Rufina, imbued with her vision of Christ, could not be weakened. The merciful Diogenianus determined to end her life of suffering. She was sent to the arena to be torn apart by lions for public entertainment. Entering the amphitheatre with the serenity of a saint she faced the beast unperturbed. Slowly the big cat approached and lay down before her. Diogenianus watched in disbelief. Astounded, he ordered she be seized, strangled, beheaded and burned. Thrown down a well with her sister, together their lifeless bodies lay still but their spirits echo through the ages.
