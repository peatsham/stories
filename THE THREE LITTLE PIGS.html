<h1>THE THREE LITTLE PIGS</h1>
<p>The rich wolf went out for his afternoon stroll. Someone had built a ramshackle straw house on the common. He was sure they did not have permission. He phoned up the council and informed them of the illegal residence. The next day he wandered past and saw the bailiffs evicting the poor unfortunate pig. The pig walked around the hillside where he came to another improvised house built from sticks. He was let in by another scruffy pig. The wolf wasted no time in reporting the illegal structure. The following day he took his afternoon stroll and was pleased to see the eviction proceeding. In the evening he checked the land registry and found out who owned the now derelict properties. Old farmer Bates was willing to sell for a good price and as the land had existing structures the wolf was granted planning permission for two family homes. His team of polecats had the houses finished and ready for sale after six months. They sold for a good price. Taking his afternoon walk the wolf was happy to see the families of fluffy sheep enjoying their new residences. He continued on and was surprised to see another well built brick house. He was even more shocked when he saw the two scruffy pigs with their brother in the living room. Later he rang the council and was stunned to find out that the residence was perfectly legal with bona fide planning permission. How could they afford such a house? Undoubtedly their income was the fruits of criminal activity. He was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. After dark he put on his overcoat and stealthily approached the pigsâ€™ house. There they were, bold as brass, enjoying tea in the living room. He sneaked up to the wall of the house and edged up to the window but he could not hear their conversation through the double glazing. Down on all fours he crept beneath the window and moved around the corner to the end of the house where he could access the chimney breast. Nimbly he climbed up and leant over into the chimney. Now he could hear the conversation but not clearly. Yes they were talking about money and goods of some sort but he needed to hear more. He edged himself further into the chimney. What was that they said? He stretched a little further and -Oh my god- he lost his grip and fell down the chimney. He landed with a thud. The sharp edged fire grate split his cranium and the pressure from the fall broke his neck. What a shock for the poor pigs. They phoned the emergency services and the meerkats quickly arrived. They declared him dead by misadventure. How sad that a respected member of the community should have perished in such unfortunate circumstances. The pigs lit a fire to remove the unpleasant odour, drank some more tea and lived happily ever after.</p>
