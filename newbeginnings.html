<h1>NEW BEGINNINGS</h1>
He packed up his mule and headed for the track out of the village . A local neighbour called him to come back . He paid no heed . He was decided . He followed the path up the mountainside past the heather and gorse and along the stoney way . The sheep scuttled away and the flies buzzed past him . The clouds relieved him of the sunâ€™s glare as he neared the top . He paused to contemplate the view . Small hills like the one on which he stood . The village of San Antonio clustered in the next valley . He turned back to the path and descended . Into the shade of the olive trees and down towards the river . Arriving at the gentle slope of the sheltered river beach he tied his mule to a sturdy branch and sat down on a large stone . He watched the reflections on the glistening clear flow of water . He was relieved to be away from the people of the village . He went to his pack and rooted out a net . Walking a little way by the river he came to a small bay . He weighted down the net to the bottom of the pool with stones, brought the upper edge to the surface and strung it up to the branch of an overhanging tree . Moving away from the river he looked for firewood in the olive grove . He found an old dry limb . This was ideal for a slow burn and returning to the shore he laid it down by his seat . A little way back up the path he pulled up a dead gorse bush for kindling . He returned to the mule and relieved it of its load and led it to the water to drink . Watching birds swoop down he waited while it drank . He returned it to its tether and fed it a handful of grain . He sat on his stone and broke the gorse into small twigs and gathered it into a tidy pile . With his lighter he set it aflame . The gorse flared up and crackled . He laid on more twigs and thicker branches . The flames steadied and he felt the warmth from the glow . The mule stood by with heavy eyelids slowly falling to a close . He left the fire and returned to his trap . Already two fish were caught by their gills as they unwittingly swam through the fine net . He extracted them and lay them on the bank . He retrieved his net ,picked up the fish, and headed back to the fire . He piled on more branches and placed the thick limb across the fire . He took a small pan from his pack and a handful of rice . From the river he scooped some water and nestled the pan into the side of the fire . He threw in the fish and sliced in a clove of garlic . As the twighlight descended the water began to bubble . The bats swooped above the river . He lit a small gas lamp and hung it nearby . The water boiled away and left the rice and fish ready . He ate the rice and holding the fish by their heads and tails carefully bit away the hot meat . Satisfied he rolled out his bed and lay down to rest and let his mind float away with the gentle babble of the river .
