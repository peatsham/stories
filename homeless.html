  <h1>HOMELESS</h1>
<p>He awakes under the bridge. Alone amongst the rubbish he rolls a cigarette. He is never short of tobacco. Cigarette ends are plentiful. One can live off the leftovers in this rich society.  Half full cans of beer and bottles of wine can be found. He is never short of food. Heroin is the challenge. It gives structure to his life. He smokes a few more cigarettes and feels relaxed. He walks to the end of the enclosure beneath the flyover and squeezes through the bent railings. A stroll up to Shepherds Bush will do him good. He arrives at his spot by the entrance to the subway beneath the A40. Someone is on his pitch! This is not good. He does not like the look of the character who is large,heavily sunburnt and falling asleep beside his can of Kestrel Super. He walks past without discussion. He decides to continue on up to Holland Park. No-one is outside the Tesco and he sits down on his coat and places his empty McDonalds cup in front of him. He retrieves some dog ends from his pocket and rolls another cigarette. Some have skunk weed in them and the heady combination assuages his longing for Heroin. Chain smoking will keep him occupied for the duration. Someone gives him a tailor made cigarette. He will smoke it after his roll up. It will not have the same hit as the tar heavy roll ups but the soft filter and elegant design will give sensuous pleasure. At last some coins drop into his cup. He retrieves them and places them in his pocket. An old lady gives him a cheese and pickle sandwich and a bottle of water. He is ready for a light breakfast and after finishing his roll-up tucks in. Maybe the sight of him eating a sandwich evokes a positive sentiment and someone drops him a fiver. His cravings are picking up and he decides to nip into Tesco for a can of K cider and then returns to his spot and discreetly drinks. A general haze cushions his discomfort. A construction worker empties his pocket of change into his cup. He counts up his coins and note and has £8.90. He still needs £6.10 to reach his target of £15 for a bag of heroin. He is starting to feel increasingly uncomfortable and feels a terrible anxiety at the idea of having to raise what suddenly seems a large amount of money. He distracts himself with the pleasure of smoking the tailor made cigarette. More pennies drop in but the meagre amounts agitate him. Then suddenly “Bingo” a very normal looking pedestrian without a second look drops a £20 note! His fragile mental state is elated and yet worried as now he must embark on the task of contacting a dealer and hoping and waiting for his arrival. Suddenly he feels he has too much money as he can now afford two bags of Heroin but the dealer may take advantage and sell him smaller amounts. The solution to the problem of addiction is within reach and yet the symptoms of withdrawal are exasperating the situation. He decides to purchase another can of K to calm his nerves.</p>
