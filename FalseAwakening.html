  <h1>FALSE AWAKENING</h1>
  <p>I awoke in my old oak bed. I felt alert and decided to rise. It was late at night and early in the morning. I walked through my bedroom door onto the landing and down the stairs. As I descended into the hall I noticed an electronic device with red lights blinking. I had never seen it before. I walked towards the kitchen and realised the light was on. I entered and looked towards the table at the other end of the room. At each end of the table, looking in my direction were two people both with indescribably repulsive faces like twisted elephantmen. I tried to scream in fear but I could make no sound. I awoke in a cold sweat.</p>
    <p>I decided to rise and be alert. It was early in the morning but late at night. I walked onto the landing through my bedroom door and down the stairs. I noticed an electronic device with red lights blinking as I descended into the hall. I had never seen it before. The light was on in the kitchen. I looked towards the table at the other end of the room as I entered. Looking in my direction, at either end of the table, were two people both with elephantmen faces twisted in repulsive ways. I tried to scream in fear but I could make no sound. I awoke in a cold sweat.</p>
   <p>I decide to rise. A compulsion drives me. I should not go. The beasts will be there waiting in their fearsome masks. They are always there waiting to undermine me. Their fateful prepossession is judging my feeble form. Their implacable stoicism will show no mercy. They will not move from their pillory positions. I descend the stair case and hear you say.</p>
<p>“No don’t go. Return to your bedroom you idiot!!” But onward I go to meet my dreaded fate. Past the blinking electronic device and into the kitchen and there they are. I begin to choke with anxiety. The fear may kill me but I awake shaking and short of breath. I try to compose myself in my cold sweat. I am really awake. My room is real and the moonlight brings objects into clear focus. I know there are no beasts in the kitchen. There is no need to go downstairs and check. I will not go. I remain in my bed and lie flat on my back in a corpse position. I am perfectly still. I do not allow myself to wriggle or fidget. With total lack of movement my body is released from irrelevance. I am a stone carved sarcophagus. I merge with the eternal power of God and mundane existence slips away like a receding tide. In my transcendent state the beasts are far away. They are powerless insignificant crumbs of cheese that fall to the floor as I eat my evening sandwich swilled down with a cold cup of tea.
