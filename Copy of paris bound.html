    <h1>PARIS BOUND</h1>
    ﻿
    <p>
      We loaded our heavy rucksacks into the back of the old peugeot pick up
      truck. The light blue 504 was a classic. The front seat stretched all the
      way across the cab and the gear stick protruded from the dashboard. The
      three of us squeezed in. My eldest brother Ewan was twenty six years old.
      He had hoboed his way through Africa and returned to buy his first house.
      His ascent of the mountain of success was just beginning. Determined to
      show initiative I had decided to hitch-hike my way around the continent. I
      was the enthusiastic sixteen year old madman with my unlikely companion
      Steve Hacking who was a year older. My first travelling companion had
      dropped out at the last minute and Steve had said he would like to come.
      Once we agreed he was totally committed to the cause. Steve was a good
      guy. He didn't smoke dope like the rest of us. He drank in moderation and
      respected his parents. I was surprised he wanted to come. His dad was the
      head of the Preston C.I.D. Possibly he thought that hitch-hiking around
      Europe with a slightly reckless fellow would be a character building
      exercise. Ewan drove us to Charnock Richard service station. He advised us
      to ask at the petrol pumps and only take a lift if it took us as far as
      the next service station. After enquiring of a few drivers we received a
      positive response. He would take us as far as M6 junction 29. He assured
      us this would be a great place to pick up a lift. Young and foolhardy we
      ignored my brother’s experience and believed the enthusiastic misguidance.
      We descended at the Warrington roundabout. No chance to chat anyone up
      here. We stood on the slip road and waited. And waited. The harsh wait of
      the hitch-hiker, not the intelligent charmer using the hitch-hiking card
      to ingratiate himself into the vehicle. One hour. Two hours. At last a
      truck stopped. He could take us to Rugby service station. A whopping 100
      miles! We climbed up into the comfortable cab. The driver had genuine
      sympathy for our disposition. He had not been persuaded to pick us up but
      had gone out of his way to pull over in his large articulated lorry. A
      kindred spirit who himself had no doubt at some time travelled on the
      margins of society. We were happy chappies. We told him of our planned
      adventure and he listened. At last we reached the service station and
      descended. Now we stuck to the plan of only accepting a lift to the next
      service station. Using this directive we made it to London in a few hours.
      Our last lift dropped us at an underground station and we took the tube to
      West Hampstead. Ten minutes walk to 33 Broomsleigh Street. We were
      expected. My brother John prepared some Harvey Wallbangers. Gin, Orange
      and a drop of Galliano. A delicious way to get pissed. His flatmate
      prepared a stir fry. Our last safe haven before we really hit the road. I
      slept under the kitchen table though Steve made it to a more comfortable
      retreat. We awoke groggy. No-one here had a car to set us off down the
      road. They nonchalantly suggested that we merely take the underground to
      Elephant and Castle and head off down the A2 for Dover. Another testing
      ground for our feeble spirits. This was not the open road but London
      conurbation! It was not a place to stand by the roadside. Pedestrians came
      and went. Cars stopped and started turning off in all directions. We
      decided to walk with our thumbs out. We appeared more like a theatrical
      performance than a serious proposition. After several hours lugging our
      heavy loads we began to reach the outskirts of the metropolis. Here the
      cars were generally propelled a longer distance. Eventually someone
      stopped. A swish businessman in a fast car going all the way to Dover! He
      had hitch-hiked as a young man. He felt he was handing down the torch. In
      the future we would probably pick up hitch-hikers ourselves. All the way
      to the ferry port we sped! Three o’clock and we were ready to cross the
      channel. We had heard that it was possible to get a free ride with a lorry
      driver but we were quite happy to pay our way. We bought our tickets and
      wandered aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waved goodbye to the white cliffs of Dover and gazed out to sea. A
      gentle respite in our challenging voyage. We arrived in France and managed
      to get a lift by asking the cars as they queued for passport control. We
      were beginning to get the hang of this! We communicated in our pigeon
      French. Any road to Paris would suit us. We just wanted to go with the
      flow. Twenty miles along we were dropped at a lonesome layby. How long
      would we wait in this foreign terrain? Quietly we meditated, taking turns
      to stick out our thumbs. The timeless zone. Eventually a kind soul
      stopped. The charming Frenchman gave off a very relaxed vibe. He was
      heading 60 kilometers. We were happy to be on the move. We began to
      improve our O level French though conversation was limited. After 30
      kilometers he pulled over for a refreshment. A ramshackle roadside cafe
      was a pleasant break. We sat at a rustic picnic table while he went to the
      cabin to order. On our frugal budget we would just bide our time while he
      imbibed. To our surprise he brought us a large bottle of beer to share.
      "Jean-Lain" was unlike anything we were used to. A dark sweet beer was
      nectar to our taste buds. He enjoyed our delight at the receipt of the
      gift. An unexpected diversion into the tranquil zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took us another 30 kilometers and dropped us at a small village along
      the road. We descended in Bernay-en-Ponthieu. The afternoon darkened to
      evening. It was too late to continue hitch-hiking. We looked around
      wondering where we might pitch our sturdy tent. A police car pulled over
      and two local officers enquired what we were doing. We explained we were
      hitch-hiking and merely wished to pitch our tent for the night. They
      thought this was a fair proposition and directed us to a field by the
      recreation ground where it would be acceptable for us to stay the night as
      long as we were away in the morning. How reasonable! We erected our Force
      Ten and sat down to our meagre ration of bread and water. Strangers in a
      strange land. After a good night’s sleep we packed up and stuck out our
      thumbs. Now it got even worse. Not one or two hours but three or four we
      waited for a lift. At last it came. But not far. Maybe this rural road was
      not the ideal route to take. Maybe sticking to the motorways like we did
      in old blighty was the best idea. The scenery was beautiful. The
      meditation of the poor man was circumstantial. Not cloistered in the
      riches of a monastery. Not admired for his equanimity. Not posing for his
      audience but genuinely coming to terms with a difficult situation in a
      composed manner. Thus came a real appreciation of life in contrast to the
      dog eat dog clamour for elevation through subjugation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen kilometers down the road in an old Renault 11. We arrived at
      another small village. We wandered to the outskirts and shaded ourselves
      beneath the large avenue of trees. Already another traveller was seated
      beneath a tree. I walked from our tree to his to say hello. He enjoyed his
      bottle of wine. He said he may hitch-hike later when the day cooled a
      little. I wondered why he didn't wish to get on his way. We stood to
      attention for the passing traffic. Would we ever make it to Paris?
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days before we had set off on our journey I had bumped into a family
      friend. Dennis has just finished University and he and his colleague Nev
      were setting off on a similar adventure to ourselves. We arranged to meet
      in Paris outside the George Pompidou centre at midday on Saturday. Having
      left Preston on Wednesday it was now Friday. There were no mobile phones
      in the olden days! Would we make it? Our present limbo cast a doubt.
      Eventually a car stopped. Another short journey took us twenty kilometers.
      Again we waited. At last another businessman took us a tidy one hundred
      kilometers. We made camp in the bushes on a roundabout and awoke to the
      sound of the morning traffic. Only sixty kilometers to Paris. The city
      sucked us in and we were dropped at a metro station. We journeyed to
      Chatelet-Les-Halles and strolled a kilometer to le centre Georges
      Pompidou. A large square in front of a colourful work of art. Pipes and
      plumbing surrounded the building. Tubes expressed themselves in bright
      primary colours. We had never seen anything like it. At ten oclock in the
      morning the marginal drinking had begun. Groups gathered. Street
      performers entertained. We breakfasted on cheese, bread and tomato. We had
      made it! But would our newly proposed companions. Dennis was an exuberant
      character. I had a quiet faith. Steve chose to be positive. We seated
      ourselves not far from the entrance. At 11 oclock they appeared! A joyous
      reunion! Fantastic! Things were looking up. Nearby was the subterranean Al
      Campo supermarket. We bought some bottles of beer and celebrated our
      successful joining. Dennis was a compulsive socialite and began to
      network. He liaised with a young Frenchman. A leather clad rebel who
      appeared to know the score. My perception of reality blurred as we made
      another visit to the supermarket for more beer. "Je ne comprends pas!" was
      my cry as I practiced my elementary French. I couldn't take my beer! We
      blended into a crusty bubble with a small crowd of French street people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke from a doze. Steve was seated against a wall calmly sipping his
      beer nearby. Dennis waltzed around the plaza ingratiating with the
      populace and Nev held the perimeter. The afternoon sailed by and we
      grounded ourselves with more food as we continued to drink. Dennis was
      small with white blonde hair. A bouncy little fella. He dressed in a
      summery cut away T-shirt and shorts. His new associate was also blonde,
      but of a different manner. Whereas Dennis sported a short fluffy swept
      back coiffure Lauren’s hair was long and greasy. A heavy mop along with
      his heavy leather jacket and bullet belt. Though the summer was here the
      jacket stayed on. Dennis astutely surmised that this pseudo rebel was a
      man we needed to know. Like Dennis Lauren had three associates in tow. A
      small bearded gentleman, a twitchy character and a large quiet type. As
      the day rolled on Dennis informed us that Lauren knew where we could sleep
      the night. Not long after dark we retreated to the car park. One corner
      was decorated with paintings of brightly coloured flowers. Pieces of
      cardboard defined an area. We rolled out our mats and sleeping bags. I
      squeezed into my elephant's foot and quickly fell asleep. I awoke in the
      night to intense illumination. Bright fluorescent strip lights stayed
      alight. I considered my situation. In the crowd life was good. I went back
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early we arose in a workmanlike fashion. Each sorted their belongings.
      Mute morning greetings acknowledged our sober beginnings. Dennis chirped
      us together and we descended the levels of car park to the subterranean Al
      Campo. Croissants, jam and take out coffee for breakfast. We mosied over
      to the Pompidou. The usual suspects conglomerated. Soon our car park
      companions arrived. Had they breakfasted? Dennis conferred with Lauren. If
      I, Nev and Denis each contributed 50 francs we could score some weed.
      Steve would not smoke. We coughed up and Denis headed off on the mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he returned with the weed, tobacco and rizla papers. With a smile on
      his face he sat down to craft a doobie. We formed a circle with our car
      park companions and passed the joint around. The tobacco made my head spin
      and I leaned against the wall till it passed and slowly the cannabinoid
      intoxication crept up on me. Life was beautiful. I watched street
      performers enact a slow motion fight. The gentle breeze rippled their
      loose clothes to accentuate their movements. After an indeterminate length
      of time we decided to shop for lunch. But first another spliff. The
      foreign brands took on a magical appeal and we perused at leisure. Dennis
      was amused by some breakfast cereal called " Smack". We settled for
      cheese, baguettes, red peppers and a block of beers with an appealing
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      We munched away and slurped down a few beers. This was the life! Steve
      continued not to smoke. In his composure he assessed that it was good
      value for money as he enjoyed our jocularity though he did not have to pay
      for it! As a cosmopolitan crowd of English, French and Italian our
      Caucasian culture seemed to set us apart from the groups of North
      Africans, mainly Algerians with curly glossy hair. Lauren objected to
      their ebullient, fiery temperaments. As one energetically gesticulated his
      way through a story he accidentally staggered our way and bumped into
      Lauren. The blonde Frenchman felt his dignity encroached. He jumped at the
      opportunity to assert his manhood. When his aggressive castigation was not
      met with cowering humility but merely a blasé shrug of the shoulders he
      was ready for war. He quickly released his bullet belt and swung for the
      Algerian. His clumsy affront was easily avoided and still the Algerians
      could only see the funny side. The Algerians moved away to avoid trouble
      and Lauren gestured towards them. He seemed pleased with himself. I could
      only think he was a fool. Still we allowed him to lead our pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not too late into the evening we returned to our car park. The flowers
      bloomed and the lights shone. We made ourselves comfortable in our home
      from home. In the morning Dennis decided we would make a tour to Notre
      Dame. We left our baggage in the car park corner and wandered out. From a
      ragged street map Denis deduced it was only a short walk over the river to
      the cathedral. We stocked up with supplies from the super. On our way we
      made a detour to pass by a fountain where we could wash. Tourists took
      photos of our ethnic pursuit. Refreshed, we arrived at the world heritage
      site. On the steps of the historic monument we popped open our midday
      beers and lunched on bread and cheese. Time for another of Dennis's
      skillful creations. Such a sense of freedom I had never known before.
    </p>
    <p>
      We meandered back to the Pompidou and converged with the car park crew.
      Dennis and Lauren consulted. Our days had gone well. The afternoon
      mellowed and we warmed our spots on the edge of the square. A spliff, a
      beer, society - what more could a man ask for? The next day we entered the
      Georges Pompidou centre. Riding the external escalators up to the third
      floor we arrived at an exhibition of the colourful Kandinsky. The elegant
      white gallery with gentle lighting allowed appreciation in a composed
      environment. What wouldn't appear beautiful? It seemed the art was merely
      a pretext to pay homage to the status quo. Only metres away was the
      decadence of the destitute, but here the equanimity of the higher orders.
      We descended to our usual level and partook in the common man's pleasures
      and later back to our cosy car park corner to bask in ultraviolet light
      amongst the colourful flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it morning I asked myself? Everyone was still asleep. Nobody stirred.
      I lay back down and contemplated. Gently I drifted back into a dream. A
      distant girlfriend caressed my hair. Rustlings awoke me. It seemed it was
      time to get up. We traipsed down to the supermarket. Dennis fancied some "
      smack" for breakfast. We purchased the cereal and a large plastic bottle
      of UHT milk. What a peculiar taste ! We each filled a large paper cup with
      cereal and milk. Rather sweet! A minute or two for digestion and it was
      time for the morning smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      We took it easy for the day as tomorrow we would voyage on. Dennis knew a
      French girl from college who lived in Tours and we were invited to visit.
      In the morning we made our way to Porte de Orleans where we would
      hitchhike out of Paris. A long line of hitchhikers stretched out along the
      hard shoulder. Where could we place ourselves? The etiquette was not
      clear. Where might the cars stop? At the end or the beginning of the line?
      Dennis and Nev opted for the beginning and Steve and I moved down to the
      end. It wasn’t long before Dennis’s cheery smile and shock of blonde hair
      had won them a lift. It seemed they had chosen the right spot! Ten o’clock
      and they were on their way ! We waited. Until twelve was our limbo. Would
      we make it to the central station for 5 o’clock? No. At 7 we arrived.
      Dennis and Nev waited patiently. We made our way to the house of
      Anne-Marie. A spacious fourth four flat with sparse furnishing expressed a
      foreign culture. We parked our luggage in the spare room. Two beds and
      ample floor space would be adequate for us. We followed Anne-Marie’s
      gentle demeanour to the local bar. Such a gentle soul was contrasted by
      her raucous crowd of companions. A leather-clad Mohican invited us to sit
      at their table. Beers were provided for us all. Dennis amused Anne-Marie
      with his zany humour. His theme was his elementary understanding of the
      French language. I found conversation with a patient young man. We were
      all accommodated by the hospitable crew. A joke sent the table flying. Not
      a drink was left standing. The happy Mohican ordered the round again. It
      seemed money was not a problem. We drank the night away with our
      sympathetic hosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke with the dawn in the minimalist living room. I had been allowed to
      languish on the sofa. The others were presumably in the bedroom. The quiet
      light cast gentle shadows across the room. I could not remember the walk
      from the bar to the flat. I savoured the calm composure though suffered
      the same hangover as I did in the car park. As the shadows slowly moved I
      carefully arose. The open plan led me to the kitchen. An empty table
      invited me to sit. I observed the functional fittings unlike an ornamented
      English kitchen where the cupboards would be paneled and the handles
      decorative here all was simple. I heard movement. The clock showed 7. Anne
      - Marie wished me a good morning and placed a bowl on the table. I
      returned the greeting and looked at the empty bowl. She prepared a jug of
      hot chocolate and filled my bowl and placed a croissant by its side. In
      keeping with the simple decor no more was required. I dipped the croissant
      and took a bite. Just what I needed! Sweet alimentation. Anne Marie
      departed for work and I drifted back into meditation occasionally
      consulting my bowl of chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last my companions arose. Chirpy Dennis wished me good morning and went
      to the cupboard for breakfast. He returned with a box of "Smack" and
      filled his bowl and added milk. Steve and Nev followed suit. Happy with
      their servings they tucked in, unaware of the speciality my marginal
      position had afforded me. We would spend the day in Tours. We had changed
      our clothes and made use of Anne Marie's washing machine. Feeling
      repatriated into civilised society we wandered into the Ville. Finding a
      pleasant park we rolled up and smoked it. Beauty returned. The sun shone.
      Dennis cracked a few jokes and pulled a silly face and we were happy. He
      decided we should treat ourselves to a coffee in the cafe. Unencumbered by
      baggage we felt like naturalised tourists. The coffee was excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Dennis's latent Christianity, hidden deeply beneath his rebellious
      front, led us to the impressive Cathedral of Saint Gatian of Tours. An
      awesomely gothic temple loomed above us. We wandered in and gazed at the
      icons. An air of serenity pervaded. Would we ever be forgiven? Maybe
      Dennis. I had little hope. We wandered back to our host where a supper of
      salad and chicken was provided. The evening took us back to the bar where
      the usual crowd made merry. We were made welcome once again and provided
      with all we wished to consume. Tomorrow back on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the Autoroute was the best option. Not the most direct, but the
      fastest road and now we had figured out we could hop from the peage, where
      people payed to enter the motorway, to the next peage. We roamed the
      queuing cars smiling through the windows hoping they would be polite
      enough to open up to us. Some completely ignored us through their
      strengthened glass. But it was not long before we persuaded a driver to
      take us along. A smooth Englishman condescended to take us. He was going
      to La Rochelle but he would only take us part of the way as he preferred
      to travel alone. It seemed as if feeling imposed upon by our presence, he
      had decided to turn his kind act into an insult. We demurely conformed to
      his show of power and thanked him kindly when he dropped us off a few
      peages along the route. More amenable lifts carried us along to our
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made it into town and searched out the youth hostel where we hoped to
      stay. Here we would meet up with Dennis and Nev. The youth hostel was
      full! What now? How would we reform our brick? No time had been specified.
      We decided to head for the municipal campsite. We pitched our force ten
      for a good price and bedded down comfortably. Steve awoke early and
      decided to take advantage of the facilities. Who should he encounter on
      the way to the shower block? Nev! Our counterparts had followed the same
      thought process and were camped not far away. What good fortune! Dennis
      expounded with smiles and exaltations. The campsite with open space, hot
      showers and a shop offered a utilitarian freedom that our previous
      accommodation lacked! After washing and croissants and coffee we were in
      fine fettle for a trip to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrying just our beach bags we strolled down the road. Dennis could not
      resist stretching out his thumb and lo and behold a jeep stopped and
      loaded us all in. With only a lady driver there was plenty of room. Once
      again we joined Dennis in laughter at our joyful journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dissimulating into average tourists on the beach we rolled one up and
      inhaled the gentle rhythm of the sea. After five minutes of contemplation
      we approached the waves. The Atlantic was cold as we launched ourselves
      in. Soon we became accustomed to the temperature and frolicked in the
      breakwater with bright sunshine to illuminate the idyllic scene.
      Refreshed, we lazed in the sun as a gentle breeze wafted over us. Waking
      from our reverie Dennis announced we were out of weed. We wandered up to
      the beach bar to have a beer. Dennis casually entered into conversation
      with a cool character hanging out at the bar. The dude sported the
      appearance of an updated version of a 1950’s rebel without a cause. Here
      was our score. Fabrice was camped on the site next to the beach. Nev and
      Steve were happy to chill in the bar while Dennis and I took a walk to his
      tent. With profits from his business he was able to afford this more
      amenable accommodation. Dennis wished to visit the toilet and undoubtedly
      check out the standard of this private resort. Fabrice conversed in good
      English as we sat in the foyer of his tent. From his leather hold all he
      pulled out a sizable bar of hashish. He heated a knife and sliced a piece
      off the soft block. He rolled it into a coil and passed it to me. I
      admired the quality merchandise as he gave me papers and tobacco to make a
      joint. I was a capable young man and completed the task efficiently. I
      offered it to Fabrice, but instead he offered me the lighter. I sparked it
      up. We had smoked our last light reefer in the morning and now, after a
      swim, sunbathe and a beer a few tokes knocked me sideways. I once again
      wondered at my renewed surroundings. Dennis returned and received the
      doobie with his characteristically quizzical look. This was good dope and
      we were very stoned. We bought a lump and returned to the bar. Nev smiled
      at our pleasant disposition. Back down to the beach where Nev could roll
      another. Nev enjoyed the reefer as Dennis and I wanted little more and
      Steve continued to abstain and bought himself another beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      How pleasant to while away the hours until the day began to cool. The
      poetic sun sank below the horizon and we strolled back to our municipal
      campsite. The concept of a leisure amenity governed by the local council
      gave a feeling of social responsibility. After our anarchic time in Paris
      we were happy in the safe enclosure. Another day at the beach would be our
      last as Steve and I needed to return to our homeland. We would make good
      progress with our introduction to hitchhiking complete! Dennis and Nev had
      only begun their journey and would soon head down to Spain. We savoured
      our final day and bade fond farewell to our faithful travelling
      companions. We managed to stay on course for our return and by the evening
      were already close to Calais. We pitched our tent in a field and were
      woken by cows beginning to nuzzle their way in. We quickly packed up and
      ventured back onto the road. A trucker picked us up and took us through
      the tunnel as passengers in his vehicle. No charge to pay! By the
      afternoon we were back at Broomsleigh Street. My brother Ewan had returned
      from his visit up North and he and John were organising a night out to see
      the legendary jazz singer Slim Gaillard.

    <p>
      Friends arrived and aperitifs were served. John had a small 2CV painted
      with an Italian flag on one side, a French one on the other, a Union Jack
      on the bonnet and a German flag on the boot! The car had originally been
      brought back from France by Ewan and then sold to some Italians who did
      the paint job. They sold it back to John when they returned to Italy.
      After over a year in the country it still remained on French number
      plates. This had served Ewan well as he had managed to bamboozle the
      Police with his act as a Frenchman, avoiding required legalities. John
      hoped to follow a similar course of action. We loaded ourselves into the
      car for our night out. We were six passengers and a driver. Ewan drove and
      John navigated. Crowded into the back were Steve and I and Hamish and Ian.
      Hamish rolled his last doobie for the ride. Ewan grumbled about the stink.
      He had tried cannabis on his journey through Africa and didn't like it.
      Steve remained silent. The rest of us toked without reservation.

      We wound our way to the Seven Dials. The Donmar Warehouse was a hip joint
      with an affordable entrance fee. Other like-minded associates were there
      to watch the legendary scatman. Had he invented rap? Possibly! His hit and
      miss showbiz life had begun in the 1930s with "Cement Mixer
      (Put-Ti-Put-Ti)" and appearances with Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and
      Dodo Marmarosa had followed. On Dizzy's advice he had taken to touring
      Europe and now resided in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started his set with "Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)"- his first
      hit recorded by "Slim and Slam" in 1938. From a sea of memories the
      classic resurfaced. Slim was the man. A nonchalant arrival on the stage
      understated the star he really was. Spontaneous applause launched us into
      a past era of jazz in the speakeasy. He picked up his guitar as though it
      was an object he was unfamiliar with and attempted to play. Slowly his
      apparent ineptitude drifted into an eloquent rendition. A similar approach
      was made to the piano. After an obscure solo on the bongo drum he launched
      into "Cement Mixer (Put-Ti-Put-Ti)". A song inspired by the sound of a
      cement mixer outside during a recording session! We loved him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He declared an intermission and strolled down from the stage to the bar.
      The crowd turned to look as he became a simple punter. Slowly the fans
      congregated around. He chose to converse with an attractive young lady who
      seemed not averse to this elderly gent's charms. He enquired which snacks
      were worthy of his delectation. The scampi fries were recommended. Made
      from only the finest ingredients the crunchy bites were to Slim's liking.
      Swilled down with a glass of lager he ordered the same again. We were
      thrilled to be part of the congregation. Even Ewan smiled his seal of
      approval. Once again he took to the stage. As he began a story in his own
      constructed language of "Vout-o-Reenee" we conferred. We wondered if the
      legendary improviser may invent a song for us. My brother John, himself a
      theatrical performer, called out for a scampi fry boogie. Slim made a
      quizzical pause and the recognizable words "scampi fries" entered into his
      scatalogical monologue in vout-o-reenee. He picked up his guitar and
      strummed a sequence of chords. With a fluid mix of vout and English he
      began a whimsical song about the sweet scampi fries. We shared John's
      elation as Slim did not disappoint. The applause resounded as the crowd
      dug it. Slim wowed us with a few more groovy numbers and after much
      appreciation we allowed him to retire.
    </p>

      Our crowd had grown to nine and we all shuffled out to the 2CV. The world
      record for people fitting into a telephone box is nine so it wasn't too
      difficult for us all to jumble into the car! We headed to the late night
      offy for supplies. At one o'clock it was a busy spot. John and I tumbled
      out of the car and went in. A few beers and a couple of wine and we
      quickly payed and headed back to the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ewan enthusiastically zoomed us down the road. Reluctantly he stopped at a
      red traffic light as a lonesome policeman patrolled his late night beat.
      He approached the car and shone his torch inside. We tried not to move. He
      made his way to the driver's door and Ewan opened his window. He smiled a
      cordial smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      -Good evening sir.-<br />
      -Good evening officer.-<br />
      -Could you put your lights on please sir?-<br />
      -Certainly officer, thankyou for your help.-<br />
      -Have a good evening sir.-<br />
    </p>

      Our luck was holding out! We sailed home with a joyous wind. We sprang out
      of the car and coiled into the house. Beers were popped open and we
      anticipated smoking some nice squidgy black that was purchased on our
      excursion. John delved into his pockets but there was nothing there. With
      a puzzled expression he checked and checked again. He racked his brain and
      realised it must have escaped when he pulled out his cash to purchase the
      beers in the late night shop.I volunteered to accompany him back to the
      off-licence to see if we may be lucky enough to pick it up from the floor
      where he dropped it. To make a prompt re-entry to the shop we simply
      parked the car on the large pavement on the corner. In we skipped and
      there before the counter lay the innocuous packet, unclaimed. John scooped
      it up and we exited, pronto. Back to the car we strolled. Unfortunately
      our luck was about to change. A policeman circled the suspicious vehicle.
      I advised John to secrete the hashish in his underpants, but he didn't
      think it would be necessary. He had a plan. He would follow Ewan's shining
      example and dissimulate as a Frenchman. I kept quiet as he struggled to
      speak a pigeon English and slipped back into his apparently native French.
      Unlike Ewan, John in fact had an excellent command of the foreign
      language. The policeman chose not to wave us along as a novel curiosity
      and drilled further. He wished to see some I.D. John shrugged his
      shoulders now headlong into his performance. With little warning the
      policeman decided to search him. He found an address book in his jacket
      but continued into the trouser pockets and out came the weed. John's
      enigmatic performance now entered a confused state. Having pulled out the
      plum the good boy of the law savoured his morsel. John was shuffled into a
      van and I was left to wander the streets. The 2CV remained in its elegant
      posture and I found my way home, a messenger of ill tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faces were glum until someone admitted they had a small blim in
      reserve. In a subdued mood we partook of the smoke and wondered what had
      become of brother John. A knock at the door awoke us from our dream. The
      fuzz wanted to speak to John Eastham. They had a Frenchman in custody who
      claimed to be his guest. They presented him before us. We nodded in
      complicity. He approached my rucksack leant against the wall and began to
      look for his I.D. We watched in fascination at John's continuing
      performance. A few of us retreated to the back room and conferred with
      Ewan. After momentarily considering the situation he took swift action. He
      entered the front room and pronounced to the police that this was in fact
      his brother John Eastham. The old bill looked from one to another. They
      were not to be fooled. This was a genuine Frenchman. John sighed with an
      air of resignation and gave up the ghost. With a painful look he admitted
      in clear English that he was in fact John Eastham. Now they were even more
      determined to see I.D. John fetched his passport and with looks of
      disbelief they matched him to his photograph. The police began to see the
      funny side. John had been a co-operative though deceptive perpetrator.
      They took his details, charged him with possession of cannabis and left
      him at home. Ewan berated his foolishness and left us to our smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an evening! We decided that the situation had resolved reasonably
      well though John had to bear the brunt of the legislature against him.
      After everyone had finally retreated to their beds Steve and I rolled out
      our mats and climbed into our bags. In the morning we took the tube to
      Edgware for the last leg of our journey. After a wait at the junction we
      stuck to the service stations and in a few hours were back in Preston. Our
      last lift was with a Prestonian and after hearing of our adventure decided
      he would drop us off at our home addresses! Steve descended outside his
      house in Penwortham. I wished him farewell and continued to Barton where
      the amenable driver dropped me at the end of our bumpy drive. I kicked a
      stone down the little lane and reached our house where my mother greeted
      me with a smile of relief.
