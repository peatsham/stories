<h1>KATY</h1>
Katy was fucked. She cooked up a hit and banged it up her ass. It wasn't enough. She headed out and picked up a quarter bottle of vodka to wake up. Rod may lay her on a bag. Up to the X bridges. She slipped into the Bailey building and up the stairs. As she approached the flat she saw the old neighbour Tom’s door was open. She waltzed into the living room. The lechy bastard looked her way. On the table was a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and a healthy looking wallet. He crumbled a sizable chunk of hash into the joint he was building on the sofa. Katy straddled the armchair.
-Things going well Tom?-. He looked over at Katy’s lithe legs. One bent up on the seat and the other placed firmly on the floor. A sheen of sweat reflected the curve of her muscle.
-Got paid- replied Tom. Katy leaned forward. Her hands clutched the plush velvet and her straightened arms pressed her small tits together. Tom's leary eyes followed the flesh to the pleated skirt and up the cotton vest.
-Happy days- affirmed Katy. His glazed eyes moved up to her intent gaze. She pushed herself his way on the soft limb of the chair.
        Tom rolled up the reefer and licked the sticky edge. He concentrated on the completion of his task. Katy eased off her vest and dropped it on the sofa beside him. As he twisted the tip of the smoke he eyed the fallen garment. He looked up at her naked torso staring at her pert breasts. She stood up and moved closer and gently took the spliff from his right hand and the lighter from his left. She sparked it up and gave him back the lighter. He placidly received it as she passed in front of him and walked to the bedroom. The soft pale skin of her elegant figure was only interrupted by the small black skirt.
-Tom?- she called -You comin'?-He looked at the doorway and rose to the occasion. He moved his heavy body into the opening. Katy sat on the bed with knees up and legs apart. Her lifted skirt revealed the soft inside of her legs. Her tight red knickers squeezed into the parting of her pussy.
-Fancy a blow back?-
Tom clambered onto the bed and Katy turned the red hot head of the bifter into her inviting mouth. Her wet lips took hold as Tom proffered his open cavity. Her nubile nipples dangled down as she moved onto all fours. She blew out a long plume of smoke as Tom greedily inhaled. He turned to lean back on the bed head. Katy extracted the gasper and passed the dampened stem to Tom's fat fingers. She straightened her nimble frame.
-How about a drop of JD?-
Tom smiled with eyes wide open. Katy stood up and flicked back her thick bob of raven hair and swiftly returned to the living room. She picked up the wallet and took out the thick wad of notes and rolled them up. Lifting up her skirt she pulled out her knickers, pushed the money up her wet cunt and hoisted them tightly round her pouting vulva. She slipped her vest on, skipped through the door and couldn't resist slamming it behind her. She laughed as she bounced into a trot and quickly sped up into a run. As she reached the stairs the door opened and Tom shouted.
-Bring back my fuckin money or I'm callin the police!- Katy launched herself down the steps at a pace. No way would that old git catch her. She flew down the four floors. As she reached the doors she heard sirens. They were quick. She exited and slowed into a brisk walk. The squad car pulled up and out popped a male and female officer. 
-Excuse me miss could we have a word?-
-Certainly-
-Have you just come from visiting Tom Dooley?- 
-Yes- 
-He believes you have stolen three hundred pounds from him- 
- That dirty old bastard! Cuz I won't drop me fucking knickers he accuses me of robbin him. Well grabbing my tits is assault!-
- You deny the charge. Would you mind if I gave you a quick search?-
-Go right ahead!-
The female officer patted Katy's waste and hips. There was little place else the money could be concealed. 
Katy began to cry.
-I can't believe it!-
The police could see no conclusive evidence.
-We will make a call on Mr Dooley. We may need to speak to you again.-
-I just wanna go home.-
The sympathetic policewoman let her continue on her way but she had no intention of going home. She took a turn towards the train station and speeded up her pace. Soon she was on the train to Plymouth. She breathed a sigh of relief.
