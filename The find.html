<h1>THE FIND</h1>
  <p>I left the house and wandered down the hill and along the path by the river. The water was high and threatened to burst the banks. I wondered whether I would be able to access the bridge. The gravel path was still above water and I crossed over to the woods. I trudged up the muddy incline amongst the trees where the drops of water fell. I arrived at my spot and settled down on a comfortable boulder. I pondered problems and let the rhythm of nature ease them away. Behind me was a shallow cave and water percolated through the rocks dripping onto the stone below. Listening to the gentle taps I noticed one unlike the others. A metallic echo, not the dead sound of stone. I looked around and perched between the stratas was an old black kettle. A dirty, damp old black kettle. But where the water touched the grime, copper showed beneath. I faced forward to contemplate the greenery. A few minutes of dreaming and I felt relaxed and ready to trek home. I stood up and turned to the kettle. I took it by the sturdy handle and headed back. Encountering no one I made it to the house and up to my room without having to explain where I found the kettle. I placed it in the cupboard to dry off.</p>
            <p>Two days later I opened the cupboard and the kettle had a crusty black layer. I placed it on my desk and with an old brush began to clean it up. The dirt flaked off and a fine dust floated into the air. So much dust I began to cough and stopped the cleaning. An incredible cloud engulfed me. The room disappeared as I was surrounded by the haze. Before me was a large demonic face. I marvelled at the evil beauty as it spoke- "What is my master’s wish?" Confounded, I sat and gazed as the vision slowly blinked its heavily outlined eyes. Trembling with fear I spluttered- "Go away ! Leave me alone!" The sharply defined mask lost its focus and faded into the mist. The air cleared and I stared at the bland kettle. I waited for the devilish container to cool and carefully placed it back in the cupboard. I wanted nothing to do with this evil spirit.</p>  
                      <p>That night I slept uneasily, disturbed by strange dreams of other worlds. I awoke before dawn and was determined to rid myself of the dastardly kettle. I dressed and left the house as the dawn broke. Carefully carrying the kettle at arm’s length I feared I sensed a weird rumbling. I arrived at my spot and placed the kettle exactly as I had found it. I seated myself on my boulder and found solace with the trees. Without looking back I walked down the path and away from the kettle and I have never been back there again.</p>
