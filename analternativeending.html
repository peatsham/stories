  <h1>AN ALTERNATIVE ENDING</h1>
<p>And they lived happily ever after …. to begin with. They had met in the
forest. Ermingild was a peasant girl out hunting with her bow and arrow. So
able she could provide adequately for herself, sisters and mother. Prince
Aethelstan was at sport with his merry band of men. They had pursued a deer
and lodged several arrows into her torso, but still she continued to run.
Ermingild saw the injured hind coming her way. With a skilful shot she put it
out of its misery. She walked over to the kill as Aethelstan descended from
his horse. Together they gazed at the beast. Her arrow had pierced the left
eye and the point protruded out of the right. From the bleeding brown eyes
they looked to one another. Transfixed they struggled to bring words to the
fateful moment. Remembering her status Ermengild tactfully apologised for
having denied his royal highness the final shot. Still dumbfounded Aethelstan
lay aside his royal elevation and praised her fine archery. If she had no
objection the meat would be prepared as the main dish for the beltane banquet
in three days time to which she was cordially invited. The date was set and
she humbly accepted the gracious offer and retreated. Aethelstan and his men
returned home in a quieter than usual mode. Ermingild’s sisters and mother
were overjoyed. The feast was joyous and their love cemented. A month later they were married. They revelled in one
anothers beauty and the adoration of formal occasion. Aethelstan felt fully
satisfied with their society but Ermingild needed a break from their constant
involvement. They did not conceive a child. When they were not at court
Aethelstan would enjoy the hunt with lifelong companions but Ermingild
preferred to make trails alone and return to her mother’s humble abode with
her kills. With Ermingild’s help her attractive sisters were soon married to
local nobility. Her mother found accommodation in one of their mansions.
They bore children and unlike Ermingild both became totally absorbed in their
stately lives. With no duty to care for anyone Ermingild began to wander.
Aethelstan provided her with strong horses and gold but she travelled as a
rustic hunter and camped in the woods on her solitary treks. Appearing as a
young man she entered country towns to sell her rabbits, hares, pheasants
and pigeons and bought goods with small coinage. Aethelstan amused himself
with the pleasures of the palace and found solace with his oldest friends.
Ermingild sold her horse and crossed over to Europe on foot. She travelled
through the continent and disappeared into Africa. Aethelstan was happy that
his brother’s marriage bore a son as heir to the throne. He lived to an old
age and never forgot the beautiful Ermingild who could shoot an arrow better
than any man he had ever known.</p>
