  <h1>THE DRUM</h1>                 
  <p>Isaac was looking for an old disc. He had remembered a structure he had used to make a game when he was a child. He rooted through some old boxes. He found an old drum. A simple goatskin drum his father had given him. Tired from his fruitless search he sat on the floor with the drum. He tapped out a simple rhythm. Using his fingers on each hand he created a paradiddle. Four beats and its corresponding inversion. He repeated. And again he repeated. This was what he needed. A simple meditation to take his mind away from his problems. He concentrated not on a complex evolving code but a monotonous pattern. A great sense of relief swept over him. For hours he drummed. At last he was exhausted. He lay down on his bed. Now he could think clearly.</p> 
                  <p>He thought of his failing employment. The economic downturn had ruined projected sales. His task was to analyse social media trends and propose an alternative advertising scheme. Realistically he could see no possible solution. He would make an attempt and fail. He would accept a proposal to resign and receive his redundancy payment. He would be free.  He was not a poor man. Royalties and investments would provide him with an adequate income. He would leave this god forsaken city and travel to the lands of his ancestors.</p>
                   <p>He drifted to sleep. He dreampt of the open plains of Botswana. He walked with his tribesmen. They trekked to the hunting grounds. In calm contemplation they felt undistracted. Unified in their goal and protected by modimo. He awoke in the dark with a profound sense of contentment. His path was clear. He picked up his drum and resurrected an ancient rhythm. The beats of the drum sounded the footsteps of lives gone by. The dream remained vivid. The feeble trappings of the western world crumbled away as he basked with the badimo. His intention confirmed he returned to his bed and rested till morning.</p>
                  <p>As he dressed for work his clothes felt alien. His newfound resolution occupied his mind. In the morning meeting he was questioned as to how he could rectify the situation. He stated that to continue with the present scheme was the best option. He could see the looks of disbelief from the board of directors. Soon afterwards he was approached by the chief executive and informed he would have to come up with a better solution. By the end of the week he was informed that the business was restructuring and his contract would not be renewed. The next week he resigned. He bid the company farewell and returned to his lonely drum. With each beat his vision became clearer. It would not be long now. He would cast off his chains and be free.</p>
