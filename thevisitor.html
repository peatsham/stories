<h1>THE VISITOR</h1>
John awoke abruptly to the sound of knocking on the door. Who could it be at this
hour? He consulted his bedside clock. 7.30 a.m. It was dark. He normally
went to bed about two o'clock in the morning and arose around midday. To him
it was the middle of the night. Again the sound of knocking. He dragged himself
out of bed and pulled on his dressing gown. Groggily he went down the stairs
and answered the door. A tall figure waited in the subdued streetlight. He
recognised his younger brother Pete. What a surprise! Though shocked he
remembered his mother had told him he may be coming. Pete smiled and wished
him a good morning. Assimilating the situation he returned the greeting and invited him in. Pete set down his heavy rucksack
on the stone floor and found himself a seat. The rustic Spanish townhouse had a
simple style. Panelled cupboards were painted with a thick green paint. An old
gas cooker stood independently with a coffee pot and milk pan ready for
action. John began to prepare the beverage. He enquired about Peteâ€™s journey.
Pete explained he had taken the plane from Tel Aviv to Zurich and changed for
the flight to Santiago de Compostela. They had last met at their parents home
in Lancashire before Pete had left to study architecture at Brighton
polytechnic. Pete had not adjusted to the student lifestyle and after a year
decided to travel. With his student allowance he had caught a plane to Israel
where a friend was working on a kibbutz in the Golan heights. Finding his old
companion he had been allowed to join the community. From there he had
managed to find work on a farm and after a few months had saved up a few
hundred pounds. He had travelled for three months down into Egypt and the
Sudan fascinated by the people and landscapes. When his money was dwindling he
had made it back to Israel and joined another kibbutz near Jerusalem. He
stayed there a couple of months and his mother had come to visit him. They
had toured Israel visiting the Dead Sea and Jerusalem. She then persuaded him
to fly to Spain to visit his brother. John made Pete the coffee and showed him the spare room where he could stay.
He had to go back to bed to complete his sleep and he would meet him for lunch
later. The day was dawning and Pete took the opportunity to find his way
around the beautiful medieval town of Santiago. Winding his way through the
labyrinth of ancient streets he discovered the jumble of bars and restaurants
and found peaceful composure in the large stone square. He sat on the steps
and contemplated his new environment.
